     * Password-based encryption generates a cryptographic key using a user
     * password as a starting point. We irreversibly convert the password to a
     * fixed-length hash code using a one-way hash function, adding a second
     * random string as &quot;salt&quot;, to prevent hackers from performing
     * <em>dictionary attacks</em>, where a list of common passwords are mapped
     * to their hashed outputs -- if the hacker knows the hashing algorithm used
     * and can gain access to the database where the hashcodes are stored, they
     * can use their &quot;dictionary&quot; to map back to the original password
     * and gain access to those accounts.</p>
